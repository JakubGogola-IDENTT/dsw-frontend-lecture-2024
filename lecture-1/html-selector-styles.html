    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p id="intro">This is a simple example of an HTML document with CSS selectors.</p>
    
    <p class="highlight">This paragraph has a yellow background, using a class selector.</p>
    
    <div>
      <p>This paragraph is inside a div and will have blue text using a descendant selector, and bold text because of the child combinator selector.</p>
      <span>This span inside the div is not affected by the child combinator selector because it only targets direct children.</span>
